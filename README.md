# Core_W4_Independent_Project_Hypothesis_Testing_Notebook
This repository contains a colab notebook containing a project on Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing on the Autolib Dataset

Description of the project
Autolib is an electric car sharing company that rents out three types of cars i.e the bluecar, utilib and the utilib 14.
The company operates in different area codes/locations in the city of Paris and runs throughout the week. As the data scientist of the company, 
I have conducted prior analysis and have found out that the blue car is the most popular in comparison to the utilib and the utilib 14 cars. 
However, some people still have a prefence for the utilib and the utilib 14 cars hence all three types of cars are still supplied to the different locations. 

The management would like to understand how to improve their supply of the blue car as it is the most popular so as to cater for the demands of the people in the city of Paris. 
At the moment, there is no way to tell how high or low the demand for the blue car is in a certain area code. 
For this reason, there is an assumption that the number of transactions recorded for a given area code reflects to the demand of the blue car in that area code. 
I would like to investigate that claim by answering the following questions: 
Is it correct to say that the demand for the blue car is higher in area codes that have more number of records and vice versa? 
If this claim is correct, how do we tell the difference in demand for the blue car where area codes have an equal number of transactions recorded? 
Do we assume that since the area codes have the same number of transactions recorded then the demand for the blue car is equal in those area codes?

By answering this question, I will help the management make better decisions when they are supplying/distributing the blue car to the different area codes. 
This will help avoid oversupply or undersupply of the blue car.
